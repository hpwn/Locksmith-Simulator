## Setting Up for Contributions

### Twitch Streaming

1. **Twitch Account Setup**:
   - If you don't already have a Twitch account, create one.
   - Configure your Twitch settings to automatically save and publish VODs (Video on Demand).
   - Ensure your streams are publicly viewable.

### Contribution Process

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**:

   - Fork the 'Locksmith Simulator' repository.
   - Clone your fork to your local machine.

2. **Making Changes**:

   - Create a new branch for your changes.
   - Make your modifications in this branch.

3. **Submitting Contributions**:
   - Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
   - Push your changes to your fork.
   - Open a pull request to the main repository with a detailed description of your changes.

## Tracking Contributions

### Contribution Spreadsheet

- First [Visit our Trello Board for Development Tasks and Progress](<Your_Trello_Board_Link>)- Use the provided public spreadsheet to log your contributions.
- For each contribution, record:
  - The date and duration of your contribution.
  - The specific commit(s) your contribution relates to.
  - A link to the relevant Twitch VOD.
  - The specific minute range in the VOD that shows your contribution.
- Log using the [Compensation Tracker Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CK9yurmRs39DacZI-M3QNruKTv1JHryGBdpihkHQHDE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Best Practices for Streaming

- Clearly mention the task or issue you are working on at the start of your stream or display "currently working on: " text on screen.
- Ensure that your stream captures both your face and your desktop for the entire duration of your work.
- Regularly verbalize your thought process to provide context to your work.

## Compensation Model

- Compensation is based on recorded and verified contributions.
- Contributions are compensated based on the time logged in the public spreadsheet and corresponding VOD evidence.
- Compensation is contingent on future project revenue and will be distributed according to the recorded contributions.

## Code of Conduct

- Adhere to professional and respectful behavior at all times.
- Refer to the full Code of Conduct for detailed expectations (link to the document).
